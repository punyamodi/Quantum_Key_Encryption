# Encryption-Decryption-Quantum-Computing-Project
This is capstone project for my Quantum Computing by Qubit by Qubit. In this project I made a web-application where I can encrypt a message a decrypt a message with Qkd. It's a secure platform for future Quantum Cryptography

**Description:**
This project implements a Secure Chat Interface utilizing Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for encryption and decryption, ensuring robust security for communication. The application allows users to securely exchange text messages and images while safeguarding the confidentiality and integrity of data.

**Features:**

1. User authentication through login and registration.
2. Encryption and decryption of messages using BB84 key exchange method.
3. Secure image transfer with encryption via QKD.
4. Integration of QR code generation for sharing encryption keys.

**Technologies Used:**

1. Python
2. Streamlit framework for building web applications
3. Pillow for image processing
4. NumPy for numerical operations
5. OpenCV for image encoding and decoding
6. PyQRCode for QR code generation

**How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
3. Run the Streamlit application by executing streamlit run app.py in the terminal.
4. Access the application through the provided URL and interact with the secure chat interface.
